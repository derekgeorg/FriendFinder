# FriendFinder
The Friend Finder app is built using Node and Express servers.

The two HTML pages (Home,Survey) were built using Bootstrap. 
*I used a button that included a glyphicon for the first time. Yay!*

The app's Homepage greets the user via a Bootstrap Jumbotron.

If the user selects the "Go to Survey" button (with glyphicon:), user is taken to /survey page.

There, user is asked for Name and Link to a photo image. As well as, 10 questions to be answered on a 1-5 tiered selection.

Once "Submit" button at the bottom of the survey is selected, results are added to API Friends list. This list can be found by clicking the link in the footer of the same name.
